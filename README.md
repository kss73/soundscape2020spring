# Project 1: Soundscape Narrative

This soundscape summarizes a whole day going into hosting a party. I decided to pick this story line for my project because my roommates and I had just recently hosted a house party and I wanted to represent how the whole day went from morning to night. The first half of my soundscape is of me cleaning as I added sounds of vacuuming, sweeping, laundry and more. Then, the second part is of people entering as the party begins and slowly the background music and conversations get louder and louder as the night progresses. Eventually everyone leaves and I take the trash out and head to bed.
